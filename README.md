Hi. This a starter theme called *Secondthought*. It's a theme meant for hacking so don't use it as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning it into the next, most awesome, WordPress page out there. That is it's purpose.

The theme has beautifull default styling so you don't have to style every little thing if the default is good enough.

Here is a list of some of the more interresting things in the theme.

-	A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
-	A helpful 404 template.
-	Fulle compatible with [WooCommerce](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/)
-	Custom stylesheets for TinyMCE to give the backend the same styles as the frontend while editing.
-	Custom admin color scheme.
-	Responsive design Out-of-the-box, with seperate desktop and off-canvas mobile navigation.
-	Ready to use [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) integration
-	Smartly organized starter SCSS folder that will help you to quickly get your design off the ground.
-	The MIT license in license.txt. Use it to make something cool.

## Install

Setting up your project is easy.

1. If it is not installed already, install [Bundler](http://bundler.io/) with the command:
> $ gem install bundler

2. Next we'll use Bundler to install gem dependancies:
> $ bundle install

  This will make sure you have the correct version of the required gems installed.

3. Third step is to install node modules with [npm](http://nodejs.org/):
> $ npm install

4. Last step is to install project dependancies with [Bower](http://bower.io/):
> $ bower install
